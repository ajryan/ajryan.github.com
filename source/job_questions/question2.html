                    I am currently in the acceptance testing phase of the addition of an integration API to my employerâ€™s pharmaceutical quality control software. It was a big challenge and quite enjoyable. The company that originally developed the application was acquired by my employer a year ago. Being new to the application, the project required me to quickly acquire deep knowledge of the business rules of the application and simultaneously learn more about WCF. Knowing that our customers will need to integrate with a broad range of platforms, I worked with the constraint of maximum possible interoperability. I ensured high unit test code coverage of the API that had the additional benefit of covering areas of the underlying backed not previously covered by automated testing.

                    Outside of working hours, I enjoy contributing to the open source community and learning new technologies. I created the TFS Test Steps Editor for Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010 test cases (http://teststepseditor.codeplex.com) and am a contributor to the JabbR chat application (http://github.com/davidfowl/jabbr), a demonstration application for the SignalR async signaling library for ASP.NET.
