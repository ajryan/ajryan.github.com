I've published my first jQuery plugin! JobViteBox fetches a feed of job listings from JobVite and displays it on your page.<!--more-->

It's been a fun learning experience exploring the jQuery API. I've used this as an opportunity to brush up on my JavaScript best practice
knowledge, and to dig deeper into jQuery internals.

Having spent most of my development career writing C#, it's very rewarding to work in a language that allows such fast iteration. I've
been using `rack` to whip up a local HTTP server for testing the demo. Another fun tool that I pulled in is [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/YQL/)
for converting an XML feed into JSON.

You can see the plugin in action on my [home page](http://ajryan.github.com).
