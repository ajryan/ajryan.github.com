I spoke at [Silicon Valley Code Camp](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/) on October 5th. The title of my talk was "Responsive Re-Engineering," and it focused on adapting desktop-only web sites to be mobile friendly. I want to thank the organizers and all of the folks who attended the talk. If any of you are reading this and you'd like to talk more about Responsive Web Design, [get in touch](http://twitter.com/ajryan)! It was a great experience: lots of great questions and an awesome venue. The [code samples](https://github.com/ajryan/CodeCamp2013) and [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AidanRyan2/responsive-reengineering) are online.<!--more-->
