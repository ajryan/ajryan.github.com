                <h2>What are your thoughts about Consulting: Pros/Cons?</h2>
                <p>
                    I think consulting is a great opportunity to develop technical and analytical skills. Taking on several projects in diverse environments provides a unique opportunity to learn what users really need and how to deliver it. I work in a small software development group that is part of a large bio-tech organization, almost an “internal consulting” group. I really enjoy the wide range of challenges and people I have had the benefit of working with. It has allowed me to push my technical skills but, more importantly, to learn how to help users express the problems they need to solve in the most objective way possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I imagine a downside to consulting, that I have experienced in my role as well, is that the development group is ultimately beholden to external management that may not have a complete understanding of the impact of requirement and scope changes, or the desire to be responsible for their cost.
